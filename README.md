# Ollama Chat - Chatbot with Ollama

This project implements an autonomous chat system using Ollama, where two artificial intelligence models interact with each other in a continuous conversation.

## 📋 Description

The project allows creating an autonomous chat where two language models communicate with each other, generating a continuous conversation. Each model acts as a different participant in the conversation, responding to messages from the other model.

## 🚀 Features

The app allows two chatbots to communicate each other: 
- Model A receives an initial message and responds
- Model B receives the first model's response and responds
- This process repeats for the specified number of turns
- Logs are saved to a json file
- Autonomous and manual mode. Switch to manual with Cntrl+C (on auto).
- Text commands to chat
- Start-of-prompt text commands:
  - `exit` - Exits. When used, the app makes a backup at "./logs/date_time" located at run path.
  - `save` - Stores a conversational context file named "context1.json" and "context2.json" at run path.
  - `restore` - Restores a conversational context file at  "context1.json" and "context2.json" located at run path.
  - `rewind` - Goes back to a previous turn (both chats).
  - `rewind:` - Goes back an ammount of turns indicated next (both chats).
  - `auto` - Starts autonomous mode.
  - `A:` - Sends the next prompt only to model A.
  - `B:` - Sends the next prompt only to model B.
  - `AB:` - Sends the next prompt only to model A and B (no msg pass between models).
- Adds every command functionality from Ollama-Chat
- Allows recursive commands using standard Ollama-Chat commands (e.g.: `A:save`, `B:rewind:2`)
- Flow control keyboard commands:
  - `Cntrl+C` - Stops AUTO mode (if enabled).
  - `3x Cntrl+C` - Forces App exit.
     
## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Ollama installed and running
- Required packages:
  - `ollama`
  - `aiss_ollama_chat`

## 📦 Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```

4. Install package using:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

Run the program with:
```bash
ollama-chat-autonomous <model1> <model2> <prompt1> <prompt2> <numTurns> <maxLength>
```

Example:
```bash
ollama-chat-autonomous gemma3:12b-it-q8_0 gemma3:12b-it-q8_0 ./sysPrompt1.txt ./sysPrompt2.txt 10 10
```
